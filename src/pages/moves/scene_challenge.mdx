# Scene Challenge Moves

A **scene challenge** is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency.

Examples of a scene challenge include disarming a timed explosive, hacking a system while evading digital countermeasures, participating in a formal debate before a council, or competing in a hoverbike race.

## Begin the Scene

**When you face an extended or complex challenge outside of a fight**, name your objective and set its rank as formidable.

Then, envision the situation and choose the number of segments for the scene’s tension clock.

  * You are severely disadvantaged: Four segments
  * You are on equal footing: Six segments
  * You have strong advantage: Eight segments

When the clock is full, you must [Finish the Scene](Starforged/Moves/Scene_Challenge/Finish_the_Scene).

## Face Danger (Scene Challenge)

**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat within a scene challenge**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful and mark progress. On a **strong hit with a match**, mark progress twice.

On a **weak hit**, you are successful and mark progress, but also encounter a complication or setback. Envision what occurs and fill a clock segment.

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dramatic turn of events. Fill a clock segment and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). On a **miss with a match**, fill two segments and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Secure an Advantage (Scene Challenge)

**When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage within a scene challenge**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, take both. On a **strong hit with a match**, take both and mark mark progress. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Take +2 momentum
  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. Fill a clock segment and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). On a **miss with a match**, fill two segments and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Finish the Scene

**When the scene challenge tension clock or progress track is filled, or when events lead to the scene’s conclusion**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you achieve your objective unconditionally.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without cost. You must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). Make this a minor cost relative to the scope of the scene.

On a **miss**, you fail or are undermined by a dire and costly turn of events. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
