# Session Moves

The **session moves** fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.

Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

## Begin a Session

**When you begin a significant session or chapter of play**, do all of the following.

  * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](Starforged/Moves/Session/Set_a_Flag).
  * Review or recap what happened last session.
  * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

Roll   | Result
-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1-10   | Flashback reveals an aspect of your background or nature
11-20  | Flashback reveals an aspect of another character, place, or faction
21-30  | Influential character or faction is introduced or given new detail
31-40  | Seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected
41-50  | External factors create new danger, urgency, or importance for a quest
51-60  | Important character is put in danger or suffers a misadventure
61-70  | Key location is made unsafe or becomes mired in conflict
71-80  | Unexpected return of an enemy or threat
81-90  | Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view
91-100 | Unforeseen aid is on the way or within reach

## Set a Flag

**When you identify situations or topics you don’t want to include, don’t want to envision in detail, or otherwise may need mindfulness when approaching**, that content is now flagged.

When you encounter content flagged as something to approach mindfully, pause to consider or discuss its role in your story. When you come across flagged content that you would rather adjust or omit, [Change Your Fate](Starforged/Moves/Session/Change_Your_Fate).

## Change Your Fate

**When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the game for your comfort or enjoyment**, pause and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.

  * **Reframe:** This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
  * **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
  * **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
  * **Redirect:** Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
  * **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

## Take a Break

**When you resolve a progress move or complete an intense scenario**, take a few deep breaths and take some time to attend to the needs of your body. Reflect on what just happened and how it made you feel. Then, choose one.

  * Move on: Continue the session. You or an ally may add +1 on the next move (not a progress move), bolstered by your reflection and past experiences.
  * Stop for now: [End a Session](Starforged/Moves/Session/End_a_Session).

## End a Session

**When you end a significant session or chapter of play**, reflect on the events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark progress.

  * If you strengthened your ties to a connection, [Develop Your Relationship](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Develop_Your_Relationship).
  * If you moved forward on a quest, [Reach a Milestone](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Reach_a_Milestone).

If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to give focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.
