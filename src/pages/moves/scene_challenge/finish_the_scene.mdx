title: Finish the Scene
---

**When the scene challenge tension clock or progress track is filled, or when events lead to the scene’s conclusion**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you achieve your objective unconditionally.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without cost. You must <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>. Make this a minor cost relative to the scope of the scene.

On a **miss**, you fail or are undermined by a dire and costly turn of events. <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>.
