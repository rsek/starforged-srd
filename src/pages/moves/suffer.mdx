# Suffer Moves

When you bear the brunt of a failed action or make a concession, the suffer moves help resolve the cost. These moves are typically made when you must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price) and face a hardship that directly impacts your well-being and readiness, or as prompted by a move or asset.

## Lose Momentum

**When you are delayed or disadvantaged**, suffer -1 momentum for a minor setback, -2 for a serious setback, or -3 for a major setback.

When your momentum is at its minimum (-6) and you must suffer -momentum, choose one.

  * Envision how the price is paid and apply the cost to a different suffer move.
  * Envision how this undermines your progress on a vow, expedition, connection, or combat. Then, clear 1 unit of progress on that track per its rank: troublesome=3 boxes; dangerous=2 boxes; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 ticks; epic=1 tick.

## Endure Harm

**When you face physical injury, fatigue, or illness**, suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your health is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if your health is 0 or you choose to resist the harm, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health
  * Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not wounded, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 health. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 health or [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your health is 0, you must also mark wounded or permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.

Roll   | Result
-------|---------
1-10   | You suffer mortal harm. [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
11-20  | You are dying. Within an hour or two, you must [Heal](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Heal) and raise your health above 0, or [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
21-35  | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to ongoing harm, [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
36-50  | You are reeling. If you engage in any vigorous activity before taking a breather, roll on this table again (before resolving the other move).
51-100 | You are still standing.

## Endure Stress

**When you face mental strain, shock, or despair**, suffer -1 spirit for minor stress, -2 for serious stress, or -3 for major stress. If your spirit is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining stress.

Then, if your spirit is 0 or you choose to resist the stress, roll +spirit or +heart, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Shake it off: If you are not shaken, take +1 spirit
  * Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not shaken, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 spirit. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it's worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 spirit or [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your spirit is 0, you must also mark shaken or traumatized, or roll on the table below.

Roll   | Result
-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-10   | You are overwhelmed. [Face Desolation](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Desolation).
11-25  | You give up. [Forsake Your Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Forsake_Your_Vow).
26-50  | You give in to fear or compulsion, and act against your better instincts.
51-100 | You persevere.

## Companion Takes a Hit

**When your companion faces physical hardship**, they suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your companion's health is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if their health is 0 or you choose to test their resilience, roll +your companion's health.

On a **strong hit**, your companion rallies. Give them +1 health.

On a **weak hit**, if your companion's health is not 0, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) and give them +1 health. Otherwise, they press on.

On a **miss**, it's worse than you thought. They suffer an additional -1 health or you [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your companion's health is 0, they are out of action until given aid. If their health is 0 and you rolled a miss with a match on this move, they are dead or destroyed; discard the asset.

## Sacrifice Resources

**When you lose or consume resources**, suffer -1 supply for a minor loss, -2 for a serious loss, or -3 for a major loss.

If your supply is exhausted (reduced to 0), mark **unprepared**. When you suffer a loss of resources while unprepared, envision how this causes you hardship and apply the cost to a different suffer move.

## Withstand Damage

**When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment**, suffer -1 integrity for minor damage, -2 for serious damage, or -3 for major damage. If your integrity is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining damage.

Then, if your integrity is 0 or you choose to resist the damage, roll +integrity.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Bypass: If your vehicle is not battered, take +1 integrity
  * Ride it out: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if your vehicle is not battered, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 integrity. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 integrity or [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your integrity is 0, also suffer a cost according to the vehicle type.

  * **Command vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or **cursed**, mark a module as **broken**, destroy a broken module by discarding it, or roll on the table below. If the command vehicle is destroyed, [Overcome Destruction](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Overcome_Destruction).
  * **Support vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or roll on the table below. If the vehicle is destroyed, discard the asset.
  * **Incidental vehicle:** Roll on the table below.
