# Adventure Moves

The **adventure moves** encompass broadly useful actions to overcome obstacles, reinforce your position, conduct investigations, influence others, and support your fellow protagonists. When you face a peril or try to gain leverage, and another move does not apply, you'll likely find your answer among these moves.

## Face Danger

**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without a cost. Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-1).

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Secure an Advantage

**When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **hit**, you succeed. On a **strong hit**, take both. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Take +2 momentum
  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Gather Information

**When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze evidence, or do research**, roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1 momentum.

On a **miss**, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Compel

**When you try to persuade someone or make them an offer**, envision your approach. If you...

  * Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart
  * Threaten or incite: Roll +iron
  * Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow

On a **strong hit**, they'll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer.

On a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand that costs you greatly. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Aid Your Ally

**When you act in direct support of an ally**, envision how you aid them. Then, [Secure an Advantage](Starforged/Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage) or [Gain Ground](Starforged/Moves/Combat/Gain_Ground) to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you [Gain Ground](Starforged/Moves/Combat/Gain_Ground) and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a **weak hit**, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.

## Check Your Gear

**When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you have it, but must choose one.

  * Your supply is diminished: [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) (-1)
  * It's not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2)

On a **miss**, you don't have it and the situation grows more perilous. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
