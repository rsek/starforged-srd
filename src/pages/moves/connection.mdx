# Connection Moves

**Connections** are NPCs (non-player characters) who represent a deep, vital, or interesting relationship in your story. They are your tethers to the people and places of the Forge.

Make these **connection moves** when you introduce connections and as you build influence or understanding with them.

## Make a Connection

**When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion)**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.

On a **miss**, you don't make a connection and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Develop Your Relationship

**When you reinforce your relationship with a connection** by doing any of the following...

  * swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
  * completing a quest to their benefit
  * leveraging their help in desperate circumstances
  * giving them something of worth
  * sharing a profound moment
  * standing with them against hardship
  * overcoming a test of your relationship

...you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.

If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark progress. Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your legacy: troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4; epic=+5. On a **strong hit**, mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track. On a **strong hit with a match**, you may also envision how recent events bolstered your connectionâ€™s standing and raise their rank by one (if not already epic). On a **weak hit**, take +2 momentum. On a **miss**, take no lasting benefit.

## Test Your Relationship

**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Develop_Your_Relationship).

On a **weak hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Develop_Your_Relationship), but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.

  * Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
  * Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail the quest, the connection is permanently undone.

## Forge a Bond

*Progress Move*

**When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you now share a bond. Mark a reward on your bonds legacy track per the connection's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who share this connection also mark the reward. Then, choose one.

  * Bolster their influence: When they aid you on a move closely associated with their role, add +2 instead of +1.
  * Expand their influence: Give them a second role. When they aid you on a move closely associated with either role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but they ask something more of you first. To gain the bond and the legacy reward, envision the nature of the request, and do it (or [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to see it done).

On a **miss**, they reveal a motivation or background that puts you at odds. If you recommit to this relationship, roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the connection's rank by one (if not already epic).
