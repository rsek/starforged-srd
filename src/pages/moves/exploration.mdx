# Exploration Moves

The Forge is a vast, chaotic, and largely unexplored galaxy. Your sworn vows will take you through uncharted space, across the surface of inhospitable planets, and into the depths of foreboding derelicts, enigmatic alien vaults, and other perilous sites.

Will you survive these expeditions? What will they cost you? What wonders and horrors will you face? Use the **exploration moves** to find out.

## Undertake an Expedition

**When you trailblaze a route through perilous space, journey over hazardous terrain, or survey a mysterious site**, give the expedition a name and rank. Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If you...

  * Move at speed: Roll +edge
  * Keep under the radar: Roll +shadow
  * Stay vigilant: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark progress per the rank of the expedition.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.

  * Suffer costs en route: Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-2), or two [suffer moves](#Suffer-Moves) (-1).
  * Face a peril at the waypoint: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to confront an immediate hardship or threat. Do not mark progress, and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Explore a Waypoint

**When you divert from an expedition to examine a notable location**, roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, choose one. On a **strong hit with a match**, you may instead [Make a Discovery](Starforged/Moves/Exploration/Make_a_Discovery).

  * Find an opportunity: Envision a favorable insight, situation, resource, or encounter. Then, take +2 momentum.
  * Gain progress: Mark progress on your expedition, per its rank.

On a **weak hit**, you uncover something interesting, but it is bound up in a peril or reveals an ominous aspect of this place. Envision what you encounter. Then, take +1 momentum.

On a **miss**, you encounter an immediate hardship or threat, and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). On a **miss with a match**, you may instead [Confront Chaos](Starforged/Moves/Exploration/Confront_Chaos).

## Make a Discovery

**When your exploration of a waypoint uncovers something wondrous**, roll on the table below or choose one. Then, envision the nature of the discovery and how it is revealed.

## Finish an Expedition

*Progress Move*

**When your expedition comes to an end**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you reach your destination or complete your survey. Mark a reward on your discoveries legacy track per expedition's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this expedition also mark the reward.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you face an unforeseen complication at the end of your expedition. Make the legacy reward one rank lower, and envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, your destination is lost to you, or you come to understand the true nature or cost of the expedition. Envision what happens and choose one.

  * Abandon the expedition: Envision the cost of this setback and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
  * Return to the expedition: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the expedition's rank by one (if not already epic).

## Set a Course

**When you follow a known route through perilous space, across hazardous terrain, or within a mysterious site**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you reach your destination and the situation there favors you. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you arrive, but face a cost or complication. Choose one.

  * Suffer costs en route: Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-2), or two [suffer moves](#Suffer-Moves) (-1).
  * Face a complication at the destination: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). If you overcome this obstacle, you may push on safely to your destination.
