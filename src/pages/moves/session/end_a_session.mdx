title: End a Session
---

**When you end a significant session or chapter of play**, reflect on the events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark progress.

- If you strengthened your ties to a connection, <RouterLink to='/moves/connection/develop_your_relationship'>Develop Your Relationship</RouterLink>.
- If you moved forward on a quest, <RouterLink to='/moves/quest/reach_a_milestone'>Reach a Milestone</RouterLink>.

If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to give focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.
