# Combat Moves

The Forge is a perilous galaxy. Factions fight for control. Pirates hunt the spaceways. Raiders prey on vulnerable settlements. Dangerous creatures and chaotic terrors stalk the unwary. Dreaded foes and powerful forces will oppose your sworn quests. Eventually, you'll be forced to fight.

When you face one or more foes in high-stakes, action-oriented conflict, use the **combat moves**. These moves encompass on-foot action and vehicle sorties—or both as part of the same challenge.

## Enter the Fray

**When you initiate combat or are forced into a fight**, envision your objective and give it a rank. If the combat includes discrete challenges or phases, set an objective with a rank for each.

Then, roll to see if you are in control. If you are...

  * On the move: Roll +edge
  * Facing off against your foe: Roll +heart
  * In the thick of it at close quarters: Roll +iron
  * Preparing to act against an unaware foe: Roll +shadow
  * Caught in a trap or sizing up the situation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, take both. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Take +2 momentum
  * You are in control

On a **miss**, the fight begins with you in a bad spot.

## Gain Ground

**When you are in control and take action in a fight to reinforce your position or move toward an objective**, envision your approach and roll. If you are...

  * In pursuit, fleeing, or maneuvering: Roll +edge
  * Charging boldly into action, coming to the aid of others, negotiating, or commanding: Roll +heart
  * Gaining leverage with force, powering through, or making a threat: Roll +iron
  * Hiding, preparing an ambush, or misdirecting: Roll +shadow
  * Coordinating a plan, studying a situation, or cleverly gaining leverage: Roll +wits

On a **hit**, you stay in control. On a **strong hit**, choose two. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Mark progress
  * Take +2 momentum
  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss**, your foe gains the upper hand, the fight moves to a new location, or you encounter a new peril. You are in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## React Under Fire

**When you are in a bad spot and take action in a fight to avoid danger or overcome an obstacle**, envision your approach and roll. If you are...

  * In pursuit, fleeing, dodging, getting back into position, or taking cover: Roll +edge
  * Remaining stalwart against fear or temptation: Roll +heart
  * Blocking or diverting with force, or taking the hit: Roll +iron
  * Moving into hiding or creating a distraction: Roll +shadow
  * Changing the plan, finding a way out, or cleverly bypassing an obstacle: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you succeed and are in control. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you avoid the worst of the danger or overcome the obstacle, but not without a cost. Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-1). You stay in a bad spot.

On a **miss**, the situation worsens. You stay in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Strike

**When you are in control and assault a foe at close quarters**, roll +iron; **when you attack at a distance**, roll +edge.

On a **strong hit**, mark progress twice. You dominate your foe and stay in control.

On a **weak hit**, mark progress twice, but you expose yourself to danger. You are in a bad spot.

On a **miss**, the fight turns against you. You are in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Clash

**When you are in a bad spot and fight back against a foe at close quarters**, roll +iron; **when you exchange fire at a distance**, roll +edge.

On a **strong hit**, mark progress twice. You overwhelm your foe and are in control.

On a **weak hit**, mark progress, but you are dealt a counterblow or setback. You stay in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

On a **miss**, your foe dominates this exchange. You stay in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Take Decisive Action

*Progress Move*

**When you seize an objective in a fight**, envision how you take decisive action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak hit as a miss.

On a **strong hit**, you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives remain and the fight continues, you are in control.

On a **weak hit**, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.

Roll   | Result
-------|--------
1-40   | It’s worse than you thought: Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-2)
41-52  | Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe appears
53-64  | You face collateral damage: Something is lost, damaged, or broken
65-76  | Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost
77-88  | Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance
89-100 | It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective is revealed

On a **miss**, you are defeated or your objective is lost. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Face Defeat

**When you abandon or are deprived of an objective**, envision the consequence of this failure, clear the objective, and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

If the fight continues, you may create a new objective and give it a rank to represent the changing situation. If any objectives remain, the fight continues and you are in a bad spot.

## Battle

**When you fight a battle and it happens in a blur**, envision your objective and roll. If you primarily...

  * Fight at range, or using your speed and the environment to your advantage: Roll +edge.
  * Fight depending on your courage, leadership, or companions: Roll +heart.
  * Fight in close to overpower your foe: Roll +iron.
  * Fight using trickery to befuddle your foe: Roll +shadow.
  * Fight using careful tactics to outsmart your foe: Roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, you achieve your objective unconditionally. You and any allies who joined the battle may take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

On a **miss**, you are defeated or the objective is lost. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
