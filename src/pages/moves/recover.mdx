# Recover Moves

Life as an Ironsworn is not easy or comfortable. When your resources are strained, your health and spirit ebbing, your equipment and vehicles in disrepair, you'll need to find relief from the perils of the Forge and the burdens of your sworn oaths.

Make these **recover moves** when you attempt to rest, recover, or refit.

## Sojourn

**When you spend time recovering within a community**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, this is a safe refuge. You and your allies may each choose two recover moves: [Heal](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Heal), [Hearten](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Hearten), [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair), or [Resupply](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Resupply). Instead of rolling, assume an automatic strong hit for each. An individual move can be taken more than once.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but time is short or resources are strained. You and your allies each make one recover move instead of two, with no more than three moves total among the group.

On a **miss**, choose one.

  * The community needs your help, or makes a costly demand in exchange for safe harbor. Envision what they ask of you. If you do it, or [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to see it done, resolve this move as a strong hit.
  * You find no relief, and the situation grows worse. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Heal

**When you receive medical care or provide treatment**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

  * Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
  * Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
  * Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
  * Provide care: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2) or [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) (-2).

On a **miss**, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Hearten

**When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you [Sojourn](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Sojourn), take +1 more.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1).

On a **miss**, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Resupply

**When you attempt to bolster your readiness**, envision the opportunity and your approach. If you...

  * Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
  * Threaten or seize: Roll +iron
  * Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
  * Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take +1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.
  * If you are in need of a specific item or resource that can reasonably be obtained, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle.

On a **miss**, you encounter an unexpected peril. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Repair

**When you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other devices**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

  * Make your own repairs, or direct a companion to make repairs: Roll +wits
  * Obtain repairs from someone (not an ally): Roll +supply

On a **hit**, you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the table below. Additionally, you may [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) and exchange each _1 of supply for 1 extra repair point (up to 3 points).

Situation     | Strong Hit | Weak Hit
--------------|------------|---------
At a facility | 5 points   | 3 points
In the field  | 3 points   | 1 points
Under fire    | 2 points   | 0 points

Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.

  * Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points
  * Fix one broken module: 2 points
  * Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point
  * Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point
  * Repair any other device: 3 points
  * Repair any other device, but with a complication or malfunction: 2 points

On a **miss**, the repairs are not made and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
