title: Finish an Expedition
progress_move: true

**When your expedition comes to an end**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you reach your destination or complete your survey. Mark a reward on your discoveries legacy track per expedition's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this expedition also mark the reward.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you face an unforeseen complication at the end of your expedition. Make the legacy reward one rank lower, and envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, your destination is lost to you, or you come to understand the true nature or cost of the expedition. Envision what happens and choose one.

- Abandon the expedition: Envision the cost of this setback and [Pay the Price](/moves/fate/pay_the_price).
- Return to the expedition: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the expedition's rank by one (if not already epic).
