**When you divert from an expedition to examine a notable location**, roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, choose one. On a **strong hit with a match**, you may instead [Make a Discovery](/moves/exploration/make_a_discovery).

- Find an opportunity: Envision a favorable insight, situation, resource, or encounter. Then, take +2 momentum.
- Gain progress: Mark progress on your expedition, per its rank.

On a **weak hit**, you uncover something interesting, but it is bound up in a peril or reveals an ominous aspect of this place. Envision what you encounter. Then, take +1 momentum.

On a **miss**, you encounter an immediate hardship or threat, and must [Pay the Price](/moves/fate/pay_the_price). On a **miss with a match**, you may instead [Confront Chaos](/moves/exploration/confront_chaos).
