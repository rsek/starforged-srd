title: Undertake an Expedition
---

**When you trailblaze a route through perilous space, journey over hazardous terrain, or survey a mysterious site**, give the expedition a name and rank. Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If you...

- Move at speed: Roll +edge
- Keep under the radar: Roll +shadow
- Stay vigilant: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark progress per the rank of the expedition.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.

- Suffer costs en route: Make a <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer'>suffer move</RouterLink> (-2), or two <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer'>suffer moves</RouterLink> (-1).
- Face a peril at the waypoint: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to confront an immediate hardship or threat. Do not mark progress, and <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>.
