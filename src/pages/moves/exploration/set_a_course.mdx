**When you follow a known route through perilous space, across hazardous terrain, or within a mysterious site**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you reach your destination and the situation there favors you. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you arrive, but face a cost or complication. Choose one.

- Suffer costs en route: Make a [suffer move](starforged/collections/moves/suffer) (-2), or two [suffer moves](starforged/collections/moves/suffer) (-1).
- Face a complication at the destination: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must [Pay the Price](starforged/moves/fate/pay_the_price). If you overcome this obstacle, you may push on safely to your destination.
