**When you follow a known route through perilous space, across hazardous terrain, or within a mysterious site**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you reach your destination and the situation there favors you. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you arrive, but face a cost or complication. Choose one.

- Suffer costs en route: Make a <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer'>suffer move</RouterLink> (-2), or two <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer'>suffer moves</RouterLink> (-1).
- Face a complication at the destination: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>. If you overcome this obstacle, you may push on safely to your destination.
