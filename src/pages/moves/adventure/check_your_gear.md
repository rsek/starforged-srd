title: Check Your Gear
---

**When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you have it, but must choose one.

- Your supply is diminished: [Sacrifice Resources](/moves/suffer/sacrifice_resources) (-1)
- It's not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: [Lose Momentum](/moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-2)

On a **miss**, you don't have it and the situation grows more perilous. [Pay the Price](/moves/fate/pay_the_price).
