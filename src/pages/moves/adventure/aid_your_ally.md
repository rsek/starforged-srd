title: Aid Your Ally
---

**When you act in direct support of an ally**, envision how you aid them. Then, [Secure an Advantage](/starforged-srd/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) or [Gain Ground](/starforged-srd/moves/combat/gain_ground) to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you [Gain Ground](/starforged-srd/moves/combat/gain_ground) and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a **weak hit**, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.
