title: Aid Your Ally
---

**When you act in direct support of an ally**, envision how you aid them. Then, <RouterLink to='/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage'>Secure an Advantage</RouterLink> or <RouterLink to='/moves/combat/gain_ground'>Gain Ground</RouterLink> to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you <RouterLink to='/moves/combat/gain_ground'>Gain Ground</RouterLink> and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a **weak hit**, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.
