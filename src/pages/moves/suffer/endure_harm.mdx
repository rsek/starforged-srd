title: Endure Harm
---

**When you face physical injury, fatigue, or illness**, suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your health is 0, <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if your health is 0 or you choose to resist the harm, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

- Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health
- Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not wounded, you may <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> (-1) in exchange for +1 health. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, itâ€™s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 health or <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> (-2). If your health is 0, you must also mark wounded or permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.

| Roll   | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-10   | You suffer mortal harm. <RouterLink to='/moves/threshold/face_death'>Face Death</RouterLink>.                                                                                                                      |
| 11-20  | You are dying. Within an hour or two, you must <RouterLink to='/moves/recover/heal'>Heal</RouterLink> and raise your health above 0, or <RouterLink to='/moves/threshold/face_death'>Face Death</RouterLink>.      |
| 21-35  | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to ongoing harm, <RouterLink to='/moves/threshold/face_death'>Face Death</RouterLink>. |
| 36-50  | You are reeling. If you engage in any vigorous activity before taking a breather, roll on this table again (before resolving the other move).                                                                      |
| 51-100 | You are still standing.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
