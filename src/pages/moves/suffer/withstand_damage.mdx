title: Withstand Damage
---

**When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment**, suffer -1 integrity for minor damage, -2 for serious damage, or -3 for major damage. If your integrity is 0, <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> equal to any remaining damage.

Then, if your integrity is 0 or you choose to resist the damage, roll +integrity.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

- Bypass: If your vehicle is not battered, take +1 integrity
- Ride it out: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if your vehicle is not battered, you may <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> (-1) in exchange for +1 integrity. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 integrity or <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> (-2). If your integrity is 0, also suffer a cost according to the vehicle type.

- **Command vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or **cursed**, mark a module as **broken**, destroy a broken module by discarding it, or roll on the table below. If the command vehicle is destroyed, <RouterLink to='/moves/threshold/overcome_destruction'>Overcome Destruction</RouterLink>.
- **Support vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or roll on the table below. If the vehicle is destroyed, discard the asset.
- **Incidental vehicle:** Roll on the table below.

| 11-25  | Destruction is imminent and unavoidable. If you do not have the means or intention to get clear, <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/endure_harm'>Endure Harm</RouterLink> or <RouterLink to='/moves/threshold/face_death'>Face Death</RouterLink>, as appropriate.                                                             |
| 26-40  | Destruction is imminent, but can be averted if you <RouterLink to='/moves/recover/repair'>Repair</RouterLink> your vehicle and raise its integrity above 0. If you fail, see 11-25.                                                                                                                                       |
| 41-55  | You cannot <RouterLink to='/moves/recover/repair'>Repair</RouterLink> this vehicle until you <RouterLink to='/moves/recover/resupply'>Resupply</RouterLink> and obtain a crucial replacement part. If you roll this result again prior to that, see 11-25.                                                                |
| 56-70  | The vehicle is crippled or out of your control. To get it back in action, you must <RouterLink to='/moves/recover/repair'>Repair</RouterLink> and raise its integrity above 0.                                                                                                                                            |
| 71-85  | It’s a rough ride. All aboard must make the <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/endure_harm'>Endure Harm</RouterLink>, <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/endure_stress'>Endure Stress</RouterLink>, or <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/companion_takes_a_hit'>Companion Takes a Hit</RouterLink> move, suffering a serious (-2) cost. |
| 86-95  | You’ve lost fuel, energy, or cargo. <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/sacrifice_resources'>Sacrifice Resources</RouterLink> (-2).                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 96-100 | Against all odds, the vehicle holds together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
