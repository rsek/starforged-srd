title: Endure Stress
---

**When you face mental strain, shock, or despair**, suffer -1 spirit for minor stress, -2 for serious stress, or -3 for major stress. If your spirit is 0, <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> equal to any remaining stress.

Then, if your spirit is 0 or you choose to resist the stress, roll +spirit or +heart, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

- Shake it off: If you are not shaken, take +1 spirit
- Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not shaken, you may <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> (-1) in exchange for +1 spirit. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it's worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 spirit or <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> (-2). If your spirit is 0, you must also mark shaken or traumatized, or roll on the table below.

| 51-100 | You persevere.                                                                                       |
