**When you are in a bad spot and fight back against a foe at close quarters**, roll +iron; **when you exchange fire at a distance**, roll +edge.

On a **strong hit**, mark progress twice. You overwhelm your foe and are in control.

On a **weak hit**, mark progress, but you are dealt a counterblow or setback. You stay in a bad spot and must <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>.

On a **miss**, your foe dominates this exchange. You stay in a bad spot and must <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>.
