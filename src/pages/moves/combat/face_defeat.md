title: Face Defeat
---

**When you abandon or are deprived of an objective**, envision the consequence of this failure, clear the objective, and [Pay the Price](/starforged-srd/moves/fate/pay_the_price).

If the fight continues, you may create a new objective and give it a rank to represent the changing situation. If any objectives remain, the fight continues and you are in a bad spot.
