**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](starforged/moves/connection/develop_your_relationship).

On a **weak hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](starforged/moves/connection/develop_your_relationship), but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.

- Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and [Pay the Price](starforged/moves/fate/pay_the_price).
- Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and [Swear an Iron Vow](starforged/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail the quest, the connection is permanently undone.
