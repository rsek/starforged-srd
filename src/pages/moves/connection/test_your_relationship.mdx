title: Test Your Relationship
---

**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, <RouterLink to='/moves/connection/develop_your_relationship'>Develop Your Relationship</RouterLink>.

On a **weak hit**, <RouterLink to='/moves/connection/develop_your_relationship'>Develop Your Relationship</RouterLink>, but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.

- Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>.
- Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and <RouterLink to='/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow'>Swear an Iron Vow</RouterLink> (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail the quest, the connection is permanently undone.
