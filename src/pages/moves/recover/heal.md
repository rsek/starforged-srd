title: Heal

**When you receive medical care or provide treatment**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

- Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
- Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
- Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
- Provide care: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: [Lose Momentum](/starforged-srd/moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-2) or [Sacrifice Resources](/starforged-srd/moves/suffer/sacrifice_resources) (-2).

On a **miss**, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](/starforged-srd/moves/fate/pay_the_price).
