**When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you <RouterLink to='/moves/recover/sojourn'>Sojourn</RouterLink>, take +1 more.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, <RouterLink to='/moves/suffer/lose_momentum'>Lose Momentum</RouterLink> (-1).

On a **miss**, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. <RouterLink to='/moves/fate/pay_the_price'>Pay the Price</RouterLink>.
