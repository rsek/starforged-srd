As you fulfill vows, build relationships, and explore the Forge, you'll mark progress on these tracks and gain experience. This experience is then spent on character assets to represent your character's growing skills, influence, and resources.</p>
<p>Make these <strong>legacy moves</strong> to gain and spend experience, and when you face a final test to learn how your accomplishments and failures will echo through time.</p></section><section><article class="iron-card ironsworn-move move-card m16"><header class="iron-card-header" color-scheme="dark"><h3 class="move-title type-display" id="earn_experience">Earn Experience</h3></header><section class="iron-card-body"><p class="mbs12 mbe12"><strong>When you fill a box (four ticks) on any legacy track</strong>, take 2 experience. This experience may be spent when you <a href="/moves/legacy#advance" class="link-move">Advance</a>.</p>
<p class="mbs12 mbe12">Once you completely fill the tenth box on any legacy track, clear that track. You may start again marking progress on the cleared track, but earn experience at a reduced rate of 1 experience (instead of 2) for each filled progress box. If you make a progress roll against this track, resolve the outcome as if at 10 progress.</p></section><footer class="iron-card-footer type-compact"><span class="iron-source-info"><cite>Ironsworn: Starforged</cite>, p. 224</span></footer></article></section><section><article class="iron-card ironsworn-move move-card m16"><header class="iron-card-header" color-scheme="dark"><h3 class="move-title type-display" id="advance">Advance</h3></header><section class="iron-card-body"><p class="mbs12 mbe12"><strong>When you develop your abilities, improve your resources, gain a reward, or boost your influence</strong>, you may spend 3 experience to add a new asset, or 2 experience to upgrade an asset.

<ul>
<li>Module: Upgrade your command vehicle</li>

<p class="mbs12 mbe12">For each <strong>strong hit</strong>, choose one from below, or one from the weak hit or miss options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow their path: Take one path or companion asset from the former character (at no cost), including any marked abilities.</li>
<li>Share a connection: Take one connection from the former character, including any accrued progress or bond benefits.</li>
<li>Accept an inheritance: Take the former character's command vehicle and one module or support vehicle (at no cost), including any marked abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mbs12 mbe12">For each <strong>weak hit</strong>, choose one from below, or one from the miss options.</p>
<ul>
<li>See it through: Choose one of the former character&#39;s unfinished quests, and <a href="/moves/quest#swear_an_iron_vow" class="link-move">Swear an Iron Vow</a> (with an automatic strong hit) to see it done. You may immediately mark up to half their earned progress (round down) on this quest.</li>
<li>Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character&#39;s connections, and envision how time or circumstances have changed them in a dramatic way. When you <a href="/moves/connection#make_a_connection" class="link-move">Make a Connection</a> with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark two ticks on your bonds legacy track.</li>
<li>Explore familiar ground: Name a location that was meaningful to the former character. When you first visit that place, envision how it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mbs12 mbe12">For each <strong>miss</strong>, choose one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former character's foes has gained power or influence.</li>
<li>Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your former character's beliefs, goals, or allegiances.</li>
<li>Open Pandora's Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.</li>
